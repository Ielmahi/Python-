5. The game will prompt you to enter a letter. Type a single letter and press Enter.
6. If the letter is correct and part of the word, it will be revealed. Otherwise, you will lose a life.
7. Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.
8. The game will display a hangman ASCII art after each incorrect guess, representing your remaining lives.
9. If you guess the word correctly, you win! If you run out of lives, you lose.
