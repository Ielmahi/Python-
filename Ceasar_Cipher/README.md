# Encryption/Decryption Python Project


## Description
This Python project allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using a simple Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features
- **Encryption:** Type 'encrypt' to encrypt a message with a specified shift number.
- **Decryption:** Type 'decrypt' to decrypt a message with the same shift number used for encryption.
- **User Interaction:** The program prompts the user for input, allowing them to encrypt/decrypt messages with ease.

## How to Use
1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Choose between encryption or decryption by typing 'encrypt' or 'decrypt'.
3. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
4. Input the shift number.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to view the result.
6. Choose to play again or exit the program.

## Example

- Type 'encrypt' for encryption, type 'decrypt' for decryption: encrypt
- Type your message: hello
- Type your shift number: 3
- Here is the text after encryption: khoor

* Type 'yes' to continue, type 'no' to exit.
